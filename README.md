# DocTest

This is a JavaScript project which basically performs document validation.
It basically compares one file to a sample file which is created prefectly in every aspects and fulfills all parametres.
It then generates a report which displays a ratio of the parametres in current document with reference to the perfect document.
Thus based on that percentage of parametres the document is either accepted or rejected.
